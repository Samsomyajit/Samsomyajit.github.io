# Welcome to My Fantasy Closet (Yes, It’s in My Head)

If you ever wonder what lives in the “spare room” of my brain when I’m not doing real-life responsibilities, it’s usually a fully stocked library with secret passages, a star map pinned to the wall, and a suspiciously helpful stranger who definitely knows where the cursed artifact is buried. 
I’ve always loved fantasy—big, mythic fantasy and also the cozy kind where the team bickers like family, someone accidentally triggers a trap, and the solution is half courage and half cleverness. 
It’s the genre that makes ordinary life feel like it has hidden doors: a train platform that might be a portal, a dusty shelf that might be a key, a quiet decision that might be the moment the hero actually becomes the hero. 
I keep returning to Star Wars because it treats myth like an engine—temptation, redemption, found family, ancient orders, and that nagging question of what you do with power once you have it—and somehow it makes even a simple choice feel cinematic, like there’s a theme music cue waiting right behind the next sentence. 
I love how it balances glittering spectacle with moral gravity, how it reminds you that “the cool move” isn’t always the right move, and how the most important battles often happen inside a person, in the split second when they decide what kind of self they’re willing to be. On the other end of my fantasy heart is The Lord of the Rings, where the grandeur is real but the soul of the story is quiet: the long road, the worn boots, the friendships that hold when everything else breaks. 
What keeps pulling me back isn’t just kings and wars, but the insistence that small hands can carry heavy destinies, that loyalty and resilience are the true artifacts, and that courage sometimes looks like getting up again when no one is cheering. And because I’m also a lifelong fan of “let’s form a party and immediately make questionable decisions,” tabletop fantasy—especially D&D—might be my favorite kind of magic. 
I love the way a table turns into a shared world, where lore becomes a group project and the best moments aren’t “winning,” but the banter, the teamwork, and the weird plan that should not work and somehow does. There’s something deeply satisfying about watching a team combine brains, bravery, and one extremely suspicious clue to outrun a curse, decode a riddle, or talk their way out of an encounter they had no business starting. 
It’s the same reason I enjoy guild vibes in games and MMORPGs: the camaraderie, the quests, the slow stubborn leveling up, and the feeling that the story belongs to the group as much as to the individual. If you’ve noticed a pattern, yes—my sweet spot is adventure with warmth: treasure-hunting energy, relics and riddles, libraries and hidden vaults, light magic and clever teams, the kind of narrative that feels like a cozy caper even when the stakes are cosmic. All of that is probably why I ended up making a sigil—a coat of arms, my own little heraldic bookmark—not as a trophy, but as a reminder.
When I look at it, I don’t see “look at me”; I see a set of symbols quietly saying, “try to be the kind of person a good story would trust.” The bear is there for strength that stays gentle, the kind that protects without posturing, patient power that doesn’t need to shout. The owl stands for watchfulness and learning, the quiet judgment that listens first and asks better questions before making big moves. The crown is storybook “lordship,” but for me it’s not entitlement; it’s responsibility—if you lead in any way, even in small everyday ways, you owe people steadiness and fairness. 
The wheel above it carries the idea of cycles, discipline, and the turning path of practice, a symbol that connects neatly to the way I like to think about growth: not as a lightning strike, but as repetition, craft, and time. 
In the center, the tree with deep roots and the tool speaks my favorite kind of magic—building. The motto, FABER FORTUNAE SUAE, “maker of one’s own fortune,” is basically my personal spell: learn, create, repair, write, train, shape; don’t wait for destiny to arrive gift-wrapped, build something worthy of becoming. And because I’m a romantic in the harmless, nerdy way, I sometimes tell myself a bit of family lore—carefully labeled as a mythic mood, not a historical claim. 
My surname, Chakraborty, has a sound that invites archetypes: the wheel-turner, the learned steward, the “Man of Letters” type who treats knowledge as both responsibility and joy. On my most imaginative days, I’ll half-joke that my family is the epitome of old-world lordship and gentlemanly conduct, even that we carry echoes of Buddhist imagery and ideals; if someone asked for proof that we’re literal descendants of Buddha, I’d laugh and offer tea, because I’m not trying to write a genealogy chart so much as a personal north star. 
What I mean by “lordship” is simple and surprisingly practical: love books, respect learning, keep your word, be restrained with power, be generous with credit, protect people rather than dominate them, leave places better than you found them, and treat kindness as a form of strength rather than a performance.
That’s the tone I want my sigil to hold: not a megaphone, but a compass. So this is my blog-post confession in one breath: I’m powered by fantasy, anchored by a code, and kept light by humor. I don’t need to be a king to live the story; I just need to be the sort of person who can be trusted with a map, a lantern, and a library card—and if I get dramatic about it sometimes, that’s fine, because every decent hero gets dramatic at least once per chapter, preferably right before the party discovers that the “harmless relic” is, in fact, extremely not harmless.
