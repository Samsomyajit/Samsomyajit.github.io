<!-- Intro / Welcome section -->
## Welcome
Welcome to my personal academic website. I am an AI researcher working at University College Cork specializing in Large Language Models, Network Science, and Visual Analytics. My work spans Language Models, Computational Intelligence, Decision Making, Cognition, Optimization, Game Research, and Physics-Informed ML. I’m open to PhD opportunities in China, Mainland Europe, and the US. If you work on AI in GIS, Physics, Law, or innovative deep learning/optimization, let’s connect and push research boundaries together.
